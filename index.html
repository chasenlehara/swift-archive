		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few months ago, I started the <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a> course. This post is a reflection on why I think anyone interested in Swift development should go through the course, and some tricks to making the most out of it.</p>
<p>My background: I‚Äôm an experienced web developer who last worked with Objective-C in the iOS 6 days. I wanted to learn Swift, and even though I have experience with UIKit, I figured SwiftUI would be an easier way to get started.</p>
<h2 id="the-course">The course</h2>
<p>The first couple weeks are solely focused on learning <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/09/22/this-has-a.html">the ins and outs of Swift</a>‚Äîno UI and no Xcode required (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-playground/">Swift Playground</a> is all you need).</p>
<p>The point of the course is to complete one day <em>every day</em> for the 100 days. I found myself itching to move faster in these first couple weeks‚Ä¶ which in retrospect, I think you can get away with doubling up on the days if you‚Äôre already an experienced programmer and mainly learning Swift‚Äôs syntax.</p>
<p>Then, the meat of the course is focused around projects where you build small apps.</p>
<p>Most of the course follows the same basic pattern for projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or more days of learning material with sample code to copy into your project and play with.</li>
<li>One ‚Äúwrap up‚Äù day with a review quiz and a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù prompt (given some requirements, write a part of the app on your own, with a couple extra hints if you get stuck but no final code to check yourself against).</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning material days are easier to get through because they are written explanations with code examples that you can copy, run, and test to see how they work. Sometimes I would do a couple of these in a single day to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù to where I was supposed to be in the whole 100 days. Don‚Äôt tell anyone. ü§´</p>
<p>I liked the quizzes as a way to double check what I had learned and reinforce the correct terminology.</p>
<p>The challenges were a mix of pure fun (when they were easier) to the real drudge of working as a software developer. That said, I thought they were really great to get me actually coding and practicing what I had learned, and that‚Äôs the real value of the course.</p>
<p>The course had a few other types of days throughout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: Build an app from scratch (based on the given requirements).</li>
<li>Milestone: Same as Challenge days, but with some extra review material to summarize the content from previous days (which I found really useful for reference).</li>
</ul>
<p>I also appreciated that, throughout the entire course, we were building ‚Äúreal‚Äù apps: <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/10/09/day-very-fun.html">unit conversion</a>, <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/10/13/day-was-really.html">a ‚Äúguess the flag‚Äù game</a>, <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/11/02/day-included-a.html">finance tracker</a>, <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/11/13/day-is-a.html">e-commerce</a> and more (there were nineteen projects altogether).</p>
<p>The course exposes you to a lot of different APIs too: <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/10/18/i-realize-that.html">Core ML</a>, <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/12/24/for-day-we-learned-a.html">accessibility</a>, <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/12/22/for-day-we-started-a.html">gestures</a>, and a whole lot more.</p>
<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>For anyone else taking the course, I have some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Really try to do one day every day, but it‚Äôs ok if you can‚Äôt. 100 days for me actually took 120, and that included some cheat ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù days where I did a couple days in one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI">project source code</a> and search it when you need help. I found myself going back to the examples for reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep around your test code with tab bars (we <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/12/15/day-and-were.html">eventually</a> learned how to use them, but not until later). Don‚Äôt shy away from creating a lot of view files for each day of learning material and displaying those views in a tab bar. <a href="https://swift.chasen.dev/2024/12/24/for-day-we-learned-a.html">Example.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are blogging about it (you should!), post screenshots of your progress. It makes it a lot more fun to look back at what you‚Äôve built. #100DaysOfSwiftUI</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs a New York lawyer called Gregory Mansfield who fights for disability rights, and he once wrote this: ‚ÄúAccessibility is not charity. Accessibility is not generosity. Accessibility is not an amenity. Accessibility is not a gratuity. You don‚Äôt bestow access ‚Äì <em>you ensure it</em>.‚Äù</p>

			 <p>On <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/74">Day 74</a> we‚Äôve started learning about accessibility.</p>
<p>I‚Äòm not a fan of how this is framed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tony Fadell ‚Äì the creator of the iPod at Apple ‚Äì had this to say: ‚Äúyou are defined by what you do and also by what you don‚Äôt do.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sure, you can skip accessibility and 90% of people won‚Äôt notice, but do you want to be defined by that? I‚Äôd wager that the answer is <em>no</em>.</p>

<p>I wish this focused on accessibility as a fundamental human right that‚Äôs needed by <em>all</em> of us at one point or another‚Ä¶ not just an arbitrary percentage (that is really low as well). #100DaysOfSwiftUI</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tip: I get lots of questions about why I place my view models into view extensions, [‚Ä¶]. This is a small app, but think about how this would look when you have 10 views, or 50 views, or even 500 views. If you use extensions like this, the view model for your current view is always just called ViewModel, and not EditMapLocationViewModel or similar ‚Äì it&rsquo;s much shorter, and avoids cluttering up your code with lots of different class names!</p>

<p>copies of the same class share their underlying data, meaning that changing one changes them all, whereas structs always have their own unique data, and changing a copy does not affect the others.</p>

<p>I found this explanation confusing until I took the test and realized the difference.</p>
<p>In JS, creating an object or class instance and assigning it to two different variables matches the ‚Äúcopy‚Äù semantics above (the variable is a reference to the object).</p>
<p>The ‚Äústruct‚Äù behavior (by value) is how primitives work in JS (string, bool, etc.). Objects never work this way.</p>
